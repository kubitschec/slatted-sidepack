What & Why
I wanted an electronics bay for my Voron Trident 250 3D printer with the following features
- more space than the standard bottom electronics bay
- accesible while the printer is standing
- configurable airflow
- multiple accesories and options in a modular system
- low vitamin count, already part of most toolboxes
- snazzy look
- right now it is only build for 3 mm panel thickness (sheet and foam tape)

Also I just grew tired of the rounded hexagons the Voron printers use for theirs skirts and wanted to use something new for my remix of the skirts

How
So I build a design system and framework for a skirt. Each skirt component is build up of a few parts
- front frame
- back frame
- a couple of slats
- some vitamins

The back frame can be either open or closed, making directing airflow trivial

Some planned extra elements:
- tft 50 screen frame
- combinend CAT6 and power panel
- 80 mm fan frame
- other ideas are welcome

Notes
I didn't want to use threaded inserts because:
- they need a lot of space
- they are quite expensive
- they aren't that strong

I originally build this set with M3 square nuts but I could see it beeing extended to M3 Hexnuts if people want it.

Sources
the projects below are things I considered and referenced their cad files. Thanks to all of the creators for publishing your work, as well as the step files!
- the standard electronics bay ([link](https://github.com/VoronDesign/Voron-Trident?tab=readme-ov-file)) gets tight pretty fast on a Voron printer with a 250 mm bed.
- the voron sidepack ([link](https://github.com/3DPrintingMods/VoronTrident-Sidepack/tree/master?tab=readme-ov-file)) requires a full rebuild of the frame, which was something I was not up for.
- the printed sideskirt ([link](https://github.com/legoman27/Printed_SideSkirt?tab=readme-ov-file)) seems to be incomplete and also does not include several features I wanted to add.
